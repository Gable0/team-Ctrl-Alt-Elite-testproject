### Basic Galaga Skeleton (root files)
- `index.html` &rarr; bare-bones page with a canvas plus quick instructions.
- `styles.css` &rarr; minimal styling so the canvas is visible against a black background.
- `js/main.js` &rarr; houses the whole framework: input tracking, player creation, update/draw loop, and stub functions for enemies/projectiles/collisions/HUD so additional systems can be filled in later.

Next steps: flesh out projectile firing, introduce actual enemy formations, and wire the collision stubs into score/health tracking.
